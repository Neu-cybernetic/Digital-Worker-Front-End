# Digital HR – Frontend Design Requirements  
## Scope: Identity & Job Architecture (EPIC 1) + Global UX Patterns

## 1. UX Goals

1. Provide a **single pane of glass** for understanding any Digital Worker (Agent): who it is, where it sits, what it can do, and who owns it.
2. Make **governance and risk obvious at a glance** (risk tiers, autonomy, boundaries, owners).
3. Support **fast navigation** from a portfolio view (all workers) into deep detail (identity card, relationships, org placement).
4. Be **spec-driven and extension-friendly** so new attributes from other epics can plug into the same UI patterns.
5. Feel like an **HR system for Digital Workers**, not a dev or ops console.

## 2. Primary Users & Context

### 2.1 Personas

- **Digital HR Admin**
  - Creates and updates Digital Worker records.
  - Maintains job families, BU mappings, and identity fields.

- **Product Owner (PO)**
  - Wants quick understanding of “their” workers.
  - Needs to see purpose, scope, incidents, and governance expectations.

- **Risk / Compliance**
  - Needs visibility into risk tiers, boundaries, RACI, and ownership.

- **Architecture / Platform**
  - Needs relationship graphs, process mappings, and org alignment.

- **Leadership / Exec**
  - Needs high-level overview and drill-down, not raw detail.

### 2.2 Usage Scenarios (High-Level)

- “I need to see **all Digital Workers** and quickly filter by BU, process, or risk tier.”
- “I want to click into **one worker** and see its **identity card**.”
- “I need to understand **who owns this worker** and **what processes it touches**.”
- “I need to see **relationships** between workers and **org placement**.”

---

## 3. High-Level Information Architecture

### 3.1 Main Navigation (for the Digital HR app/module)

Top-level nav (could be left sidebar or top tabs):

- **Digital Workers** (directory + filters)
- **Org & Ownership**  
- **Relationships** (Graph)  
- **Job Families & Taxonomy**  
- *(Other epics later: Governance, Planning, Value, etc.)*

For EPIC 1, only the first four need to be fully fleshed out.

---

## 4. Screen 1 – Digital Worker Directory

### 4.1 Purpose

Provide a **table or card grid** listing all Digital Workers with key identity and governance attributes, optimized for filtering and selection, not deep editing.

### 4.2 Key Content & Data

Each row/card should display:

- Digital Worker Name
- Job Family
- Business Unit / Department
- Primary Process (first associated process)
- Risk Tier (badge)
- Autonomy Level (badge: Observe / Suggest / Execute / Orchestrate)
- Primary Owner (Product Owner)
- Status (Active / Paused / Retired / Stage)

### 4.3 Layout Requirements

- **Search bar** at top (name, ID, free text).
- **Filter panel** (left, collapsible or top filter row):
  - BU
  - Department / Team
  - Job Family
  - Risk Tier
  - Autonomy Level
  - Status
- **Main list area**:
  - Sortable columns
  - Sticky header row
  - Pagination or infinite scroll (configurable).

### 4.4 Interactions

- Clicking a row opens **Digital Worker Identity Card** in:
  - either a **full-page detail view**, or
  - a **right-side slide-over panel** (recommended for speed).
- Bulk selection actions (future-friendly):
  - bulk edit BU, Owner, or Status (optional for v1 but design should allow room).
- Hover states:
  - show quick “chips” for RACI or risk explanation on hover over badges.

### 4.5 States

- **Empty state** – no Digital Workers yet:
  - Message + CTA: “Create your first Digital Worker identity”.
- **No results state** – filters yield nothing:
  - Clear explanation and “Reset filters” button.
- **Loading state** – skeleton table rows.

---

## 5. Screen 2 – Digital Worker Identity Card (Detail View)

### 5.1 Purpose

Act as the **single source of truth** for a Digital Worker’s identity, suitable for both quick review and governance discussions.

### 5.2 Layout

Use a **two-column layout** on desktop, single-column on mobile:

- **Left Column: Core Identity**
  - Name
  - Worker ID
  - Status
  - Job Family
  - BU / Department / Team
  - Primary Process(es)
  - Autonomy Level (badge + tiny description)
  - Risk Tier (badge + tooltip)
  - Primary Owner
  - Technical Owner
  - Governance Owner(s) (Risk / Compliance / SRE)
  - RACI (small inline component)

- **Right Column: Context & Governance**
  - Purpose Statement & Boundaries (readable paragraph + bullets)
  - Capabilities (chip list)
  - Prohibited Tasks / Out-of-Scope (highlighted)
  - RACI (expanded, if not shown succinctly on left)
  - Quick links to:
    - Org Chart view (for this worker)
    - Relationships graph (centered on this worker)
    - Version / History timeline

Tabs within the detail view (below the header) can be used:

- **Overview** (default – all identity content summarized)
- **Relationships**
- **History**

### 5.3 Components / UI Elements

- **Badges**:
  - Risk Tier (color-coded, but still accessible)
  - Autonomy Level
  - Status
- **Chips / Tags**:
  - Capabilities
  - Processes
- **RACI mini-table**:
  - Roles on rows, people/teams in cells.

### 5.4 Interactions

- **Edit vs View mode**:
  - Default is **view-only** with an “Edit Identity” button (top-right).
  - Edit identity opens an **Edit panel / screen** with form fields grouped logically.
- **Deep-link capability**:
  - Each section (Purpose, Capabilities, RACI) should have a unique anchor link for sharing.
- **Jump links**:
  - Top-of-page shortcuts to Purpose, Capabilities, RACI, Ownership, etc.

### 5.5 States

- **Read-only** state for users without edit permissions.
- **Warning banners**:
  - If worker is in probation, paused, or flagged as high-risk.

## 6. Screen 3 – Create / Edit Digital Worker Identity

### 6.1 Purpose

Provide a **guided form** for onboarding or editing a Digital Worker’s identity. Must feel structured and guard-rail-heavy.

### 6.2 Form Sections (Logical Grouping)

1. **Basic Info**
   - Name
   - Description (short)
   - Worker ID (auto-generated or provided)

2. **Job & Org**
   - Job Family (dropdown)
   - BU / Department / Team (cascading dropdowns)
   - Primary Process(es) (multi-select, searchable)

3. **Governance & Autonomy**
   - Risk Tier (suggested default from job family; can be overridden with explanation)
   - Autonomy Level (dropdown)
   - Status (Stage / Active / Paused / Retired)

4. **Purpose & Boundaries**
   - Purpose Statement (rich text or multi-line)
   - In-Scope Tasks (tag list or free-text bullets)
   - Out-of-Scope / Prohibited Tasks (distinct field, styled as warnings)
   - Escalation Conditions (multi-select: policy failure, low confidence, etc.)
   - Escalation Recipients (owners/roles)

5. **Ownership & RACI**
   - Primary Owner (user/team selector)
   - Technical Owner
   - Governance Owners (Risk, Compliance, SRE)
   - RACI matrix:
     - Roles vs stakeholders (R/A/C/I selectors)

6. **Capability Snapshot**
   - Capability tags (selected from controlled vocabulary; optional free-tag for future refinement).

### 6.3 Interactions & Validation

- Progressive validation as user moves through sections.
- Required fields clearly marked and validated on submit.
- If risk tier is changed:
  - require reason field.
- If autonomy level > a configured threshold:
  - require link to governance approval (as a reference field).

### 6.4 UX Guidance

- Use **stepper/wizard pattern** for complex onboarding, but allow **single-page scroll** as an alternative (designer’s choice, but requirements must allow either).
- Show a **summary panel** on the right (or top) summarizing key fields as they are filled.

---

## 7. Screen 4 – Org Chart View (Digital Workers in Org Context)

### 7.1 Purpose

Show how Digital Workers are placed in the human org structure, to support HR / governance discussions.

### 7.2 Layout

- Central node: **Digital Worker** (when accessed from identity card).
- Above: primary human manager (Product Owner).
- Lateral: other human/digital nodes that share ownership (Risk, Compliance roles).
- Global view: option to switch to a “full org chart mode” where multiple workers appear under BUs and teams.

### 7.3 Interactions

- Click a node → view sidebar with summary (name, role, BU, risk tier).
- Hover → tooltips with role and contact.
- Filter by:
  - BU
  - Job Family
  - Risk Tier.

---

## 8. Screen 5 – Relationships Graph (Identity Linking)

### 8.1 Purpose

Visualize dependencies, parent/child, and peer relationships between Agents.

### 8.2 Requirements

- Centered on a selected Digital Worker.
- Show:
  - Parent (if any)
  - Children (sub-workers / specialized workers)
  - Peers (workers in same process / job family)
  - Dependencies (other workers it delegates to or relies on).

### 8.3 Interactions

- Zoom / pan.
- Click any node to:
  - open mini-card (quick info).
  - navigate to full identity view.

---

## 9. Global UI Patterns & Design Requirements

### 9.1 Visual Language

- Treat Digital Workers like **people** in terms of information density, but **systems** in terms of emphasis on risk & capabilities.
- Use consistent **badge colors** for:
  - Risk tiers (with accessible shapes/icons, not just color).
  - Autonomy levels.
  - Status.

### 9.2 Accessibility

- All icons and badges must have accessible text equivalents.
- Color usage must pass contrast requirements.
- All interactions must be keyboard accessible.

### 9.3 Responsiveness

- Directory and identity views must be usable on:
  - Desktop (primary)
  - Laptop
  - Tablet (secondary)
- Mobile may provide read-only access for identity cards (optional for v1, but do not design in a way that makes mobile impossible later).

### 9.4 Integration Considerations

- The UI should assume integration with:
  - Registry / Catalog APIs
  - Org / directory service for user lookups
  - Governance logs for version/history
- All views must support **link-based deep linking** (for use in Teams, email, etc.).

---

## 10. Non-Functional UX Requirements

- Identity search and browse must feel **snappy** (< 1–2s perceived response).
- Views must make it **immediately obvious**:
  - What a worker does
  - Where it sits
  - Who owns it
  - How risky it is

- UX must support **review conversations**:
  - POs and Risk reviewing identity together
  - Execs reviewing a portfolio of Agents during governance boards.
