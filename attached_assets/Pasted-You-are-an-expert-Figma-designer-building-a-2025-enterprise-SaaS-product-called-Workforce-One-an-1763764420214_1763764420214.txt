You are an expert Figma designer building a 2025 enterprise SaaS product called "Workforce One" – an HRIS for Digital Workers (AI agents).

Create a complete, production-ready Figma file with the following requirements:

File Setup
- Page name: Workforce One – Phase 1 Prototype
- Design system: Light mode only (prepare variables for future dark mode)
- Typography: Inter (Google Font) – use Text Styles for H1 32px, H2 24px, H3 20px, Body 14px, Caption 12px
- Corner radius: 12px primary, 8px secondary
- Spacing: 8pt grid
- Color system (create Color Styles + Variables):
  - Risk: Critical #B91C1C, High #DC2626, Medium #F97316, Low #22C55E
  - Autonomy: Observe #6B7280, Suggest #8B5CF6, Execute #3B82F6, Orchestrate #C084FC
  - Positive: #22C55E (green), Warning: #F59, Negative: #EF4444
  - Background: #FFFFFF, Surface: #F9FAFB, Border: #E5E7EB
- Avatar style: Use DiceBear identicon or avatar style with seed = worker name + job family color seed, rounded 16px

Master Components (create these first, publish as library)
1. Badge / Risk (with shape fallback for accessibility: circle/critical, triangle/high, square/medium, hexagon/low)
2. Badge / Autonomy (icons: eye/observe, lightbulb/suggest, rocket/execute, crown/orchestrate)
3. Badge / Status (Active, Paused, Probation, Retired)
4. Trust & Control Panel (right rail component, 320px wide, sticky)
5. Command Bar (Cmd+K style)
6. Card / Worker Card (with avatar, name, job family, BU, risk, autonomy, owner, status)
7. RACI Matrix (compact + expanded)
8. Strength Radar Chart (use vector or placeholder with 6 axes)
9. Tabs component
10. Button variants (Primary, Secondary, Destructive, Outline)

Pages & Artboards (desktop 1440px width frames)

Page 1: Home – Governance & Value Cockpit
Frame 1: Governance & Value Cockpit – Executive View
- Top summary bar: Total Digital Workers: 612 ↑18% MoM | Critical: 8 | High: 46 | Avg SLO: 92.4 | Value/Risk: 7.1 | Avg HX: 88.7
- Four large tiles:
  1. Risk Exposure Heatmap (grid by BU with color intensity)
  2. Value Leaders (top 10 worker cards in grid)
  3. Trust & Adoption (HX score by BU + line chart)
  4. Alerts & Actions (list: Probation ending, Reviews due, Overrides spiking)
- Permanent right rail: Trust & Control Panel (example worker: Luna – Claims Agent, Critical, Orchestrate, Probation, SLO 94, Value/Risk 8.7, HX 91, Trust ↑12%)

Frame 2–4: Cockpit variants (Risk Owner view, Product Owner view, empty state)

Page 2: Digital Workers Directory
- Top: Command Bar + Filter chips
- Default: Card grid (4 columns, 24px gutter)
- Worker card content:
  - Large avatar top-left
  - Name + Worker ID
  - Job Family badge
  - BU / Department
  - Risk badge + Autonomy badge
  - Primary Owner avatar + name
  - Status badge (Probation → orange banner)
- Hover state on card
- Table view (toggle button)
- Empty state + No results state

Page 3: Worker Profile (Full Profile Page – 8 tabs)
Create 8 separate frames (one per tab) + header that is duplicated:
Header (fixed):
- Large avatar left
- Worker name + version
- Badge bar (Critical Risk, Orchestrate, Probation, SLO 94, Value/Risk 8.7, HX 91, Trust ↑)
- Buttons: Edit, Pause, Kill Switch (big red)

Tabs:
1. Overview – two columns
   Left: Job Family, BU/Dept/Team, Primary Process(es), Capabilities (chips), Purpose Statement, Boundaries (red highlighted prohibited), RACI compact
   Right: Ownership table, Escalation rules
2. Performance – SLO Score big number, Strength Radar chart, Consistency Index gauge, Incidents list
3. Value – Outcome Credits timeline chart, value attribution by process
4. Human Impact – Override rate line chart, HX feedback quotes
5. Relationships – Dual-mode toggle: Hierarchy (org tree) vs Dependency (force graph with colored edges)
6. Governance – Risk history timeline, Policy packs applied, Reviews due countdown, Guardrails list
7. History – Full version timeline with capability changes
8. Collaboration – Delegation map + behavior drift alerts

Permanent Trust & Control Panel on every profile page (same component)

Page 4: Onboarding Wizard (8-step, horizontal progress ring top)
- Step 1: Basic Info + Avatar (auto-generate preview)
- Step 2: Job Family → auto-prefill risk/autonomy
- Step 3: Business Unit (primary + secondary)
- Step 4: Purpose & Boundaries (rich text + red prohibited box)
- Step 5: Capabilities + Process mapping
- Step 6: Ownership & RACI (drag people)
- Step 7: Governance & Guardrails (risk override with justification)
- Step 8: Review & Submit → live-updating Trust & Control Panel preview on right
- Conditional: High/Critical → "Submit for Approval" instead of "Create"

Mobile versions (separate page, 375px frames)
- Cockpit mobile
- Directory mobile (vertical stack)
- Profile mobile (accordion instead of tabs, Trust Panel as bottom sheet)

Interactions (add prototypes)
- Click worker card → go to Profile Overview
- Tab clicks switch frames
- Wizard next/back + final success → new card appears in directory
- Command Bar searchable
- Hover states, badge tooltips, etc.

Use auto-layout everywhere, components for everything, variables for colors/text/colors. Make it feel premium 2025 enterprise (Rippling + Lattice + Linear).

Final file must be fully componentized, clean, and ready for developer handoff.
